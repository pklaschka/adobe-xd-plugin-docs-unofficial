# Unofficial Adobe XD API Docs

These docs are generated from the official Adobe XD Typescript Type Declarations (which are based on the official [plugin-docs](https://github.com/AdobeXD/plugin-docs)) using [`typedoc`](https://typedoc.org/).

This is in no way meant as a replacement for the official documentation, but more as an alternative platform for it!

## Motivation
Truthfully, I hate navigating the GitBook docs (they feel clumsy) and I find the pages generated by `typedoc` extremely easy to use, meaning this serves as my personal documentation browser (and has already done so before).
